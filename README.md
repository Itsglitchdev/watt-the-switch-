# Watt-The-Switch


## 💡 About the Game

**Watt-The-Switch** is an electrifying puzzle game where your goal is to save energy by stopping the electricity meter! In a world where energy conservation matters, you'll need to switch off all the lights to win - but with a shocking twist!

### The Challenge

Each level presents you with connected bulbs in a single lane. Your objective is to turn off **ALL** bulbs to stop the electricity meter and save energy. However, there's a catch:

> **When you toggle any bulb, all adjacent bulbs will change their state too!**
> - If a bulb is ON, it turns OFF
> - If a bulb is OFF, it turns ON

As time passes, your electricity bill increases, adding pressure to solve each puzzle quickly!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click/tap on bulbs to toggle their state
2. Plan your moves carefully - remember that adjacent bulbs will switch states too!
3. Turn off all the bulbs to complete the level
4. Beat all 8 increasingly challenging levels to become the ultimate energy saver
